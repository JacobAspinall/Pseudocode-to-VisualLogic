# Pseudocode-to-VisualLogic
Robot to translate pseudocode into a VisualLogic flowchart.

Instructions:

1. Snap VisualLogic to the left side of your screen
2. Make sure this program is not covering the upper lefthand corner of VisualLogic (This is how the program selects VisualLogic)
3. make sure each statement is only on one line (ie. when you reach the end of a line in MS Word, it will continue onto the line below it. It should not look this way when inside the text box.)
4. Inputs and outputs should be directly adjacent to eachother
  Good:

  output prompt                                                                                                                   input variable

  Bad:
  
  output prompt
  
  input variable
  
5.  press enter and dont touch anything while the program in running
